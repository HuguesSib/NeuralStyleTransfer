# NeuralStyleTransfer
DD2424-Project : Neural Style Transfer using ConvNets

The following branch is a cleaned-up branch of the original main. Here lies the necessary folders to run the code on a jupyter notebook or through a python executable.

FinalScript.py: Contains the neccesary code to run the styl generator on a python console

Project.ipynb: Notebook with a step-by-step guide to execute and run the code.

Boh Project.ipynb and FinalScript.py contain almost thesame information, but structured in different ways.
